# projectL2

Project to create a new way to sell gym and nutrition program.

The project has as its final objective the complete development between front-end and back-end.

The technologies to be used will be:

HTML5; CSS3; JavaScript; MySQL;

So we will have two fundamental steps.

The first will be the creation of a common website, where the customer will be able to buy the products of video-classes, courses and the like and in sequence will be able to make the purchase of the product, and finally will have access via login to watch the video classes.
